This code was written as an exta credit project for MAE 361 - Vibrations taught by Dr. Larry Silverberg
[MAE 361 - Vibrations taught by Dr. Larry Silverberg](https://www.mae.ncsu.edu/people/lmsilver/). For this activity, a State Space Analysis was utilized to compute the physical motion of a basketball interacting with an enviroment, complete with a ball launcher, horizontal and verical walls, and an event triggering basketball hoop.

Derived equations of motion were integrated using a second order [Rungeâ€“Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) numerical method. The basic outline of the code is as follows.
